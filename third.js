// types of variables 
var x =25;
var y = 100; // in var you can asign the value multiple times
// in let you can asign the value one time only
let ch = 303;
let DKSD=495839;
// const is constant 
const ty = 20 ; //this will never change

// the difference between let and var 
// var declarations are function-scoped. This means a variable declared with var is accessible throughout the entire function in which it is declared, regardless of block-level constructs like if statements or for loops.
//let declarations are block-scoped. This means a variable declared with 
// let is only accessible within the specific block (e.g., if block, for loop, or any curly braces {}) where it is defined.
// let also cant be redeclared unlike var which can be redeclared
